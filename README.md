# Robust Web Socket

A simple wrapper around the great [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) library, which tries to do everything it can to keep a web socket
connection open. Useful if you are listening to websockets which perhaps don't have the most amazing uptime.

## Install

  npm install robust-web-socket
